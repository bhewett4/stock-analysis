## Stock Analysis: Refactored
### With our stock analysis, we were looking to assist Steve in researching stocks for his parents to invest in. We took datasets for two years and compared them in order to make an educated decision. As we all know, past performance is not a guarantee of future performance, however past performance can still help us understand the performance of a security as it relates to market cycles. In 2017, the majority of the securities that we analyzed had positive performance, the frontrunner being DQ with a 199.4% return and the only negative performance by TERP with -7.2% return. Conversely, in 2018 we saw that all but two of the selected securities had negative performance. In 2018 RUN outshown the performance of the other securities with an 84% return which is a marked difference from 2017's return of 5.5%. The only security with consistent negative performance is TERP which was -7.2% in 2017 and -5.0% in 2018. ENPH has the most consistent results with a 129.5% return in 2017 and an 81.9% return in 2018.
## Refactoring Benefits and Detractors
### When refactoring this code, we gave our macro the ability to analyze the date, even if it grew exponentially. Adding arrays instead of static variables made it so that we could simply update the number of expected ticker symbols if additional securities were added. An additional benefit that we found is that the refactoring yielded results in a shorter run time. In our original analysis, 2017's results took just under a second to compute, however in the refactored exampled the results populated in a quarter of the time. Refactoring not only gave us the ability to add to our dataset without issue but yielded results in a more timely manner.
